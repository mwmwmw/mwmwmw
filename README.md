- 🔭 I’m currently working on being the Director of Interactive at [FKA](https://fka.agency)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Oryx (after the book Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood). She is fat and fluffy. I once wrote a song about her. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/27JPeIK9G3NPBO0jY3pbRE?si=7XHa9s4kQuWeqbdoP4FzFg)
