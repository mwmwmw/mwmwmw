- 📫 How to reach me: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matthewwillox/) is a good start. Reach out for any question no matter how dumb you think it is. It could be "Matthew... what are shoes?" we'll figure it out.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Oryx (after the book Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood). She is fat and fluffy. I once wrote a song about her. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/27JPeIK9G3NPBO0jY3pbRE?si=7XHa9s4kQuWeqbdoP4FzFg)
