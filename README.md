### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**mwmwmw/mwmwmw** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on being the Director of Interactive at [FKA](https://fka.agency)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything I can, always and forever.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything music or arts related.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with multiple projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web Audio API, WebGL, and React
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MatthewWillox) is a good start.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Oryx (after the book Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood). She is fat and fluffy. I once wrote a song about her. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/27JPeIK9G3NPBO0jY3pbRE?si=7XHa9s4kQuWeqbdoP4FzFg)
